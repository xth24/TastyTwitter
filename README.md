# TastyTwitter

Welcome to TastyTwitter, a Twitter botting tool designed to automate various Twitter interactions. While initially created for personal use to have some fun, this tool is being released as open-source for educational purposes or for those interested in exploring Twitter automation. Given its age and the evolving nature of the Twitter API and Anti Bot, TastyTwitter IS considered outdated and would require modifications or a complete overhaul to meet current standards (and also to clean the code).

## Features

TastyTwitter was designed with the following capabilities (note that due to API changes, some (or even all) features might not work):

- Tweeting, retweeting, and liking.
- Follow and unfollow capabilities.
- Profile customization.
- ...

## Disclamer

This tool is OUTDATED and provided as-is, with no guarantees or support. Users should be aware that automating interactions on Twitter can violate Twitter's terms of service, leading to account suspension or termination.
